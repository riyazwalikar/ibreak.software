A quick video post showing the XSPA/SSRF bug found with Yahoo! Developer Network. This bug allowed for network port scanning and banner grabbing.

This is another video demonstrating a XSPA / SSRF vulnerability that I discovered on the Yahoo! Developer Network last year. This was a typical XSPA / SSRF bug that allowed an attacker to port scan Internet facing servers using Yahoo!â€™s machines. A limited amount of service fingerprinting was also possible.

Yahoo! has now fixed this issue and was nice enough to put that in an email. Oh, by the way there was no swag, unicorns,mugs or tshirts.
